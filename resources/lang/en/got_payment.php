The membership fee for the entire term of the contract is payable in amount of 99.96 € once per year. When payment is made via a SEPA direct debit mandate, the deadline for notifying the Customer that the amount will be debited from their bank account is reduced to one day.
                <br/>
                5.2. The Provider can adjust the prices for the agreed contractual Services, subject to the following conditions.

                The Provider will notify the Customer by e-mail about planned price increases at least four weeks prior to new prices taking effect.

                From the time of receiving the notification regarding the price increase, the Customer has a right to cancellation, stipulated by Art. 8 of these General Terms and Conditions until the time of the planned price increase coming into effect. If no cancellation takes place within the prescribed period, the price increase will be regarded as accepted.

                The Provider will exercise this right of price increase maximal one time per quarter to adjust fees and charges to changing market conditions, changes to the VAT rate, or significant changes in purchasing costs.

                Price falls come into effect from the announced date. For the Customer’s membership fees, a reduction will come into effect as of the following, contractually agreed time period, unless something different has been notified.

                5.3. If the bank rejects a payment due for want of cover on the account or because the Customer cancelled the agreed direct debit, the Provider will invoice all arising expenses per rejected or cancelled direct debit. This amount will increase by the respective bank fees, plus the amount that has been contractually agreed.

                If the Customer is more than ten days in default with his payment, or if the Customer has provided false or improper payment information to the Provider, the Provider shall be authorised to block access of the Customer to the Service, after he has issued to the Customer a reminder for the payment and pointed to the imminent blocking of the Service.

                However, blocking access to the Service does not mean exercising the cancellation right, stipulated by Art. 8 of these General Terms and Conditions.

                When access to the Service is blocked, the Customer will continue to be obligated to pay the unpaid amounts due to the Provider.

                The Provider reserves its right to assert more extensive damage claims and to rescind the contract in the case of continuing default with the payments.

                If Provider determines, in its sole discretion, that the Customer is in breach of this contract, Provider may immediately commence efforts to collect any and all amounts due by the Customer to the Provider pursuant to this contract, or Provider may place this contract with a collection agency or attorney in connection with collection which may result in additional charges. The Provider shall be entitled to recover all damages, costs, fees, and expenses incurred for the collection of any and all amounts due by the Customer pursuant to this contract, including but not limited to fees and costs of any collection agency, attorneys fees, interest on unpaid amounts, court costs, and filing fees.

                <br>11.1. These General Terms and Conditions are subject to the law of the Republic of :company_country.

                The courts of the Republic of :company_country are responsible for any legal disputes arising from the validity, interpretation and/or application of these General Terms and Conditions and the contract.
                <br/>
                11.2. The Customer is only entitled to file own claims against similar types of claims by the Provider, if the Provider acknowledges the claims or if they have been legally established in favour of the Customer.

                Modifications, amendments or subsidiary agreements to these General Terms and Conditions must be in writing and confirmed by an authorised representative of the Provider in order to be valid. The amendment or omission of this clause must also be in writing.

                By means of a declaration, the Provider has the right to transfer the contract, with all related rights and duties to legal successors.

                If the contract envisages that the parties must issue their declarations in writing, this means that the said declarations must be sent by post or e-mail to the address provided by the Customer and specified by the Provider. The declarations and invoices sent by e-mail shall be regarded as having been received one week after delivery to the Customer’s electronic mailbox, if they are not retrieved. If one or several provisions of the contract or one or several provisions of the General Terms and Conditions should be fully or partially invalid, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions or specific parts of these provisions from the contract and/or the General Terms and Conditions. If necessary, an invalid or missing regulation will be replaced by the closest legal stipulation, in commercial terms.
